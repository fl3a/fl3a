### Hi there, i'm Florian 👋

Most people call me *Flo*.

I'm currently working as a *Tribe Agile Master* at [AXA](https://axa.de/).

Prior to this, i worked as *Agile Team Coach* / *Scrum Master* for serveral companies.   
Back in history i worked as a freelance IT consultant for over a decade,
focussed on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/user/51103), Linux and FLOSS in general,
while my love for Scrum was growing.   
 Back in these days i co-founded the [Drupal e.V. – German Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-ev), 
co-organised the first Drupalcamp in D-A-CH
and co-founded the cooperative [Reinblau](https://reinblau.coop/), 
an agency for conception, design and agile webdevelopment 
which runs on holacracy.

Now i focus leadership team, organisation development, collaboration and coaching.

I like the term *posttechnical* for my switch and i do the tech stuff just for fun.
