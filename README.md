### Hi there, i'm Florian ðŸ‘‹

Most people call me *Flo*.

I'm currently working as a Scrum Master at [REWE digital](https://www.rewe-digital.com/).

Prior to this, i worked as a freelance IT consultant for over a decade,
focussed on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/user/51103), Linux and FLOSS in general,
while my love for Scrum was growing.   
 Back in these days i co-founded the [Drupal e.V. â€“ German Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-ev), 
co-organised the first Drupalcamp in D-A-CH
and co-founded the cooperative [Reinblau](https://reinblau.coop/), 
an agency for conception, design and agile webdevelopment 
which runs on holacracy.

Now i focus on people who build software, teams and collaboration. 
I like the term *posttechnical* for my switch and i do the tech stuff just for fun.
